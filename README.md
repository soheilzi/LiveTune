# LiveTune: Dynamic Parameter Tuning üé∂

LiveTune is a cutting-edge Python package that empowers Machine Learning developers and researchers to adjust parameters in real-time while their program is running. Seamlessly modify variables, data, or hyperparameters, such as learning rate and regularizer, without interrupting your code execution. Experience the freedom to fine-tune your ML projects on-the-fly.

## Installation

### Platform Compatibility

| Platform | Status |
|:--------|:------:|
| MacOS üçé | Supported |
| Linux üêß | Supported |
| Windows ü™ü | Not Yet Tested |

### Installation Guide

1. Ensure you have PyPi installed. If not, [follow these instructions](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/).
2. Execute the following command in your terminal:
```bash
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ LiveTune==0.0.6
```

## Key Features

LiveTune offers two primary features: **Live Variables** and **Live Triggers**. Both are managed using our intuitive **tag system**.

Upon starting a program that integrates LiveTune, the terminal will display the port number associated with that program instance.

| Feature | Data Types | Description | Use Cases |
|:-------|:----------:|:-----------:|:---------:|
| Live Variable | int, char, string, float, boolean | Modifiable variables during runtime. | Hyperparameters, datasets, user info adjustments, etc. |
| Live Trigger | boolean | A boolean that, when triggered, returns true for a single call. | Remotely initiate functions, loops, or halt code. |


## Integration Guide

### Setting up Live Variables 
A live variable is an integer, char, string, float, or boolean that is able to be changed in the middle of the program by using a command in the terminal or in a different program.

First, import liveVar from LiveTune:
```python
from LiveTune import liveVar
```

To create a Live Variable, create a new variable in the liveVar class.

```python
myVariable = liveVar(INITIAL_VALUE, 'TAG')
```

Example usage:
```python
ranking = liveVar(100, 'ranking')
```

Live Variables can be used just like normal variables of its type, so feel free to call the variable as needed. 

To avoid resource loss or unnecessary recompiling, liveVar includes a **'changed' method** that returns True or False if the Live Variable has been changed since the last time 'changed' was called in a running instance. 

Example usage:
```python
if myVariable.changed():
    print("This variable has changed!")
```


**Note:** Derived variables from a Live Variable won't auto-update. For instance, if ranking2 = ranking + 5, modifying ranking won't affect ranking2.

## Setting up Live Triggers
A live trigger is a boolean that will always return *False* when called. If a developer "triggers" it, the boolean will return *True* the next time it is called. It can be used to trigger functions, and subroutines. 

First, import liveVar from LiveTune:
```python
from LiveTune import liveTrigger
myTrigger = liveTrigger('TAG')
```

Example usage:
```python
stopLoop = liveTrigger('stop')
while(not stopLoop()):
    pass
```

```python
save = liveTrigger('save')

while training:
    if save():
        save_subroutine()
...
```

## Updating a LiveTune Variable

Upon program initiation, LiveTune assigns a port to your instance. This port links tags to client ports temporarily.
```bash
[LiveTune] Port number for the LiveTune dictionary: 61629
```

To update a variable, use the **tune** command in the terminal or in an external program.


The tune command has a few settings to ensure the correct variable is changed properly.
| Setting | Description | Required | Example
|:-----|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| --port / -p | The port number given by LiveTune above, separate per instance. | Always | --port 63573
| --tag / -t | The developer-set tag string for the variable. Used to identify the variable. | Always | --tag ranking
| --value / -v | The new value for the variable-must match the type of the original (e.g. must be an int if originally an int) | Live Variables only | --value 200
| --trigger / -tr |  LiveTriggers will not "trigger" if this setting isn't included. | Live Triggers only | --trigger

Example terminal usage:
```bash 
tune --value 10 -t myVariable -p 13451
```

```bash 
tune --tag myTrigger --port 13451 -tr
```

You can also update livetune variables using their update method.
example:
```python
myVariable.update(new_value)
```
